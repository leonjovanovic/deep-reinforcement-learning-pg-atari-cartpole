# Policy gradient algorithms on OpenAI's Cartpole
Policy gradient algorithms (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, A2C, A3C) on  OpenAI's Cartpole

## Summary

## Environment

## Policy Gradient

## Algo 1

## Algo 2

## Algo 3

## Algo 4

## Results

    
## Rest of the data and TensorBoard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest of the training data can be found at [/content/runs](https://github.com/leonjovanovic/deep-reinforcement-learning-atari-pong/tree/main/content/runs). If you wish to see it and compare it with the rest, I recommend using TensorBoard. After installation simply change the directory where the data is stored, use the following command
  
```python
LOG_DIR = "full\path\to\data"
tensorboard --logdir=LOG_DIR --host=127.0.0.1
```
and open http://localhost:6006 in your browser.
For information about installation and further questions visit [TensorBoard github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/README.md)
